# dotFiles
Simple Things that makes me Happier @ $HOME

## Dependency (Who Watches the Watchers)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)

## Install
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

## Docker images
Even better then install everything is to create aliases and run what you need inside a container.

Take a look into my [bashrc](https://github.com/EHER/dotFiles/blob/master/files/.bashrc) for examples.

Some docker images are [here](https://github.com/EHER/dotFiles/tree/master/docker).

## Try it
You can also just give a try:
```
docker run -it --rm eher/dotfiles
```

Enjoy!
